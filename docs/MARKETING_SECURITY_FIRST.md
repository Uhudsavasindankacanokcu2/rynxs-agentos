# Rynxs (Security-First) — Governed AI Computers on Kubernetes

Rynxs lets teams run agents with real "computer capabilities" (workspace + tools) **without losing control**.

Security posture is built-in: **policy-enforced execution**, **default-deny networking**, and an **append-only audit log** with **hash-chain integrity** (tamper-evident).

HA is production-ready with **Kubernetes Lease leader election**, split-brain mitigations, and deterministic event sequencing.

Operations are first-class: **Prometheus metrics**, critical alerts + runbooks, and a go-live checklist with a <2 min smoke test.

If you need agents that can act — while remaining **governable, auditable, and incident-ready** — Rynxs is for you.
