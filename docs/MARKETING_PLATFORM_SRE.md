# Rynxs (Platform/SRE) — Production-Ready Agent Infrastructure

Rynxs is Kubernetes-native agent infrastructure designed for **operational reliability**.

Ship with one command via Helm, run **multi-replica HA**, and keep a **shared append-only event log** on S3/MinIO with integrity checks.

Leader election + failover is validated, and production hardening includes topology spread, PDB, pinned images, and controlled risk posture.

Observability is complete: metrics, alerts, runbooks, and structured JSON logs for fast debugging.

It's not "magic guarantees" — it's **mitigated, observable, forensically analyzable** behavior aligned with distributed systems reality.
