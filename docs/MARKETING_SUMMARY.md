# Rynxs is Production-Ready 🚀

Rynxs is a Kubernetes-native platform for running **governed "AI computers"** — agents with real tools (workspace, shell/browser) but with **auditability, safety, and operational control**.

In the last release cycle we shipped: **one-command Helm deploy**, **HA leader election + failover**, **S3/MinIO append-only event log with hash-chain integrity**, and **production-grade observability** (Prometheus metrics, alerts, runbooks, structured JSON logs).

This isn't "magic guarantees" — it's **mitigated, observable, and forensically analyzable** reliability, aligned with distributed systems reality.

If your team needs agents to operate with real capabilities **without losing control**, Rynxs is built for that.
