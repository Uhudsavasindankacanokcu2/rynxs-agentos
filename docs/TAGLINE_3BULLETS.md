# Tagline + 3 Bullets (Sponsors Header Format)

## Option A — General (widest audience)

**Tagline:** Governed AI computers on Kubernetes — give agents capabilities without losing control.

- **Governance & audit:** append-only S3 event log + hash-chain integrity (tamper-evident)
- **Production HA:** Lease-based leader election + split-brain mitigations + tested failover
- **Ops-ready:** Prometheus metrics + alerts/runbooks + <2 min smoke test

---

## Option B — Security-first

**Tagline:** Security-first agent infrastructure: policy-enforced execution with a tamper-evident audit trail.

- **Isolation by design:** controlled execution boundaries + default-deny networking (cluster policy/CNI)
- **Forensic-grade audit:** append-only event log + integrity validation + incident-ready metadata
- **Hardened delivery:** pinned images, deployment gates, and documented risk posture

---

## Option C — Platform/SRE-first

**Tagline:** Kubernetes-native agent platform built for reliability, observability, and safe automation.

- **HA you can trust:** single-writer best-effort via Lease + deterministic sequencing + S3 durability
- **Operate confidently:** runbooks, alerts, structured logs, and clear deploy/verify gates
- **Ship fast:** Helm install/upgrade workflows with production checklist and smoke test

---

## Option D — Ultra-short (sponsors header, minimal)

**Tagline:** Governed AI computers on Kubernetes.

- **Tamper-evident audit log**
- **Production HA + failover**
- **Complete observability**
